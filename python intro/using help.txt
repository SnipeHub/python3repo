Inside the Python interpreter, the help() function pulls up documentation strings for various modules, functions, and methods. 
These doc strings are similar to Java's javadoc. The dir() function tells you what the attributes of an object are.
Below are some ways to call help() and dir() from the interpreter:

    help(len) — help string for the built-in len() function; note that it's "len" not "len()", which is a call to the function, which we don't want
    help(sys) — help string for the sys module (must do an import sys first)
    dir(sys) — dir() is like help() but just gives a quick list of its defined symbols, or "attributes"
    help(sys.exit) — help string for the exit() function in the sys module
    help('xyz'.split) — help string for the split() method for string objects. You can call help() with that
    object itself or an example of that object, plus its attribute. For example, calling help('xyz'.split) is the same as calling help(str.split).
    help(list) — help string for list objects
    dir(list) — displays list object attributes, including its methods
    help(list.append) — help string for the append() method for list objects
