# Since Python variables don't have any type spelled out in the source code, it's 
a good idea to give meaningful names to your variables to remind yourself of
what's going on. So use "name" if it's a single name, and "names"  if it's a 
list of names etc. Many Python errors result from forgetting what type of value
is in each variable.

CamelCase is the recommended style of naming

## Do not use variable names "print" and "while", they will give an error.
