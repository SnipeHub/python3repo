\\ Welcome! \\

  I highly recommend using a GUI instead of the command line for Github. I highly recommend "Github Desktop".
  Easiest one I have found to use and glance over on what updates are happening on Github.
  https://desktop.github.com/
 
  For your text editor when writing your python code. I highly recommend Visual Studio Code,
  which is free and open source. The reason why I chose this is for the customisation, 
  simple to use and you can add the plugins to support the programming code that you are going to be using.
  It also has shortcut keys and built in Github support.
